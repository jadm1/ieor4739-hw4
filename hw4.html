      </span>Three-part assignment:<br>
      <br>
      <b>(a)</b> Extend the principal components code we developed in class so as
      to compute the top ten eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors. Run it
      on the Russell-1000 covariance matrix (computed using qas many days as you have). 
      <br> <br><b>(b)</b>Compare your code from (a) with the best numpy 
implementation you
      can find.  Do they agree (i.e. are the eigenvalues and 
eigenvectors about the same)? Which one is faster? Note that numpy comes
 with several operators
      already. <br><br>
      <b>(c)</b> Take a portfolio allocation (percentages) you computed 
for the Russell-1000 using the porfolio optimization algorithm you 
developed.  Convert them into stock quantities as per the first day 
prices, using a total
      of one billion dollars for the initial portfolio value.  This 
exercise
      asks you to run the P &amp; L analysis for the resulting 
portfolio, without
      any rebalancing (so the quantities you have on day 1 are the 
quantities
      you will have at the end).  You will run a number of simulations 
of this
      analysis, using random perturbations of the prices.  On each run 
you
      will report the final portfolio value, and the average daily 
portfolio return.  This program should be in C.<br><br>

      The random perturbations are constructed as follows.
      Consider an asset k.  Suppose that over the entire
      history, the average change (up or down) for the <b> price </b>
      of asset k (day over day) is delta[k], and the standard deviation 
for the change of price of asset k (again day over day) is sigma[k].  
Then, on each day
      t, you change the price of asset k by a normally distributed 
random variable of mean delta[k] and standard deviation sigma[k].  This 
is done independently for all assets, and for all days in the history.  
 This ensemble of new prices
      constitutes one sample, on which you need to perform the P &amp; 
L. <br>
<br>
      Do this on <b>at least</b> one million samples.  Feel free to use a
      multithreaded setup if you have a multicore machine.  
      <br>
      <b>Note</b>: you may use the "Box-Muller" transform to draw normally
      distributed values.
