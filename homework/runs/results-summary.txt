Part a) and b)

PCA on linux:
C implementation (10 eigenvalues): 1050 ms
Numpy (947 eigenvalues): 12644.0 ms
PCA on windows:
C implementation (10 eigenvalues): 1170 ms
Numpy (947 eigenvalues): 2168.0 ms

Numpy is always faster obviously.
However Numpy is 6x faster on linux than on windows with latest versions installed.


Part c)

1000 P&L simulations over 504 periods 
with multithreading on 4 cores and compiled with optimization:

For lambda = 1.0 (low risk aversion)
Portfolio assets: 8
Average final value: 2.796 billion
Average daily return: 0.3089 %
On linux done in 202.4 seconds

On windows done in 131.5 seconds

For lambda = 1000.0 (high risk aversion)
Portfolio assets: 29
Average final value: 1.284 billion
Average daily return: 0.0511 %
On linux done in 729.9 seconds
On windows done in 478.5 seconds

windows ran the simulations 1.5x faster than linux on my laptop
